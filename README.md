# Notes-Software
This is a description of my notes software and how it was made the timeline what lead up what's the purpose. Other information.

<h1> The Starting Point </h1>

I started working on this project on 12/03/2024 (DD/MM/YEAR) I started this project as I wanted to move from basic python software to more open enviroment in this case .NET C# Software making for prior knowledge I have done work in C# not a lot I did pass an introduction course for it but it did not include graphical aspects inside of said course this was more for general knowledge get you basics so I was diving into the deep end for C#. I have prior knowledge in SQL before this and had tampered around quite a lot beforehand I'm also fully aware of issues what may arise from SQL for example SQL Injections one of common OWASP Vulnerabilities I accounted for this as I do CTF's capture the flag on hackthebox a online website to learn ethical hacking.

<h1> What's The Point? </h1>

I made this repo and this software to show proof of knowledge and where motivation can take you in terms of things, I also want to show this to my college tutors as programming is huge passion of mine and want to show that <b> I truly care </b> there's many people which will do a course for the sake of a degree what they can throw down on a CV but I want this to show effort I'm willing to put in to master the skill's I have worked on fondly for 7 Years. I don't have the best vocabulary or grammar skills so some of this will be poorly worded and I'm fully accepting of this and want to use this as working off point to become better at write-up's and other skills such as software development.

<h1> Skills I Wish To Develop </h1>

<ul>
  <li>My scripting proficiency</li>
  <li>Problem solving</li>
  <li>Motivation</li>
</ul>

Software production started to clarify the Github was not made at this concurrent time the first thing
I began to work on was thelogin page keeping an ease colour on the person's eye's so I targeted colour
scheme of grey to dark-grey, lighter grey for fore-colour and dark-grey for background-colours.

I began to realize that some font's just didn't match with the theme I was going for I wanted more sharper
and not distorted font this could be just me but I just felt like it didn't match my current theme I was
going for.

To take action on this issue I started browsing font's which appealed more easily and which one's didn't
look out of place this was quite an issue to deal with. I came to the conclusion of Yu Gothic UI also I
increased the font sizes on some objects this was because their current size didn't fit to well in
addition to this I changed the font's format from bold back to regular as that caused some not good
formatting what I didn't expect would make a major change.
